    <h1>Using the LADD Roller Derby Scoreboard</h1>

         style="border: solid black 2px;">

    <h1>Setup</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When the state indicator reads "Setup", you can click on almost
        anything to change it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the logo before you change the team name.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your team's logo and name isn't in the list,
        please <a href="mailto:neale&#64;woozle.org">mail them to me</a>
        and I will add them.
      <li>
        Reload the page (click "Reload" or type F5) to get back to setup
        mode.  Scores, timeouts, and period clock time are all saved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type Space Bar or click the jam clock to begin the first jam.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Running Jams</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Press Space Bar or click the jam clock to switch between 2:00
        jams and 0:30 rotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type "A" or "B" to add points to a team's score.  You can also
        click a score to add a point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type "Shift+A" or "Shift+B" to remove points from a team's
        score.  You can also click a team logo to remove a point.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Timeouts</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
         Type "T" or click the period clock to enter into a timeout.
      </li>

      <li>
        Click a team's timeout count to remove one from it.  If it's at
        0, click it to reset it to 3.
      </li>

      <li>
        Click the period clock during a timeout to change the time left
        in the period.
      </li>

      <li>
        Type Space Bar or click the jam clock to exit timeout mode and
        start the next jam.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Periods</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Go into Timeout mode to re-set the period clock to 30:00.  Click
        it to change it to a different time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the period indicator to cycle between "Period 1", "Break",
        and "Period 2".
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Other cases</h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Halftime / Double-header break</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Type "T" to enter timeout mode.</li>
          <li>Click the period indicator until it says "Break"</li>
          <li>Click the period clock.</li>
          <li>Enter the duration of halftime.</li>
          <li>Type Space Bar to start counting down.</li>
          <li>It's okay to let the jam clock reach 0:00.</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>

      <dt>20-minute periods</dt>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>During setup or timeout, click the period clock.</li>
          <li>Enter "20:00" for the new time.</li>
          <li>Click the period indicator until it displays the
            appropriate period</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
    </dl>


    <h1>If the browser exits</h1>
    <p>
      Shit happens.  So every second, the scoreboard saves its state to the
      browser's long-term storage using the
      HTML5 <code>localStorage</code> object.  The following information
      is stored, and will come back the way it was when the browser exited:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Period clock time</li>
      <li>Team names</li>
      <li>Team logo URLs</li>
      <li>Team scores</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is a good idea to verify that your browser actually stores this
      information around before you run a bout, by starting a pretend
      jam, exiting, then re-opening.
    </p>

    <h1>Customizing the display</h1>
    <p>
      The scoreboard is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.  If you'd
      like to try your hand at graphic design, feel encouraged to do
      so.  Just remember to keep the <code>onclick</code>
      and <code>id</code> attributes in elements that have them, and
      everything should continue to work.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you come up with a new design, or code improvements, I'd love
      to see it!
    </p>

    <h1>If you have problems</h1>
    <p>
      If something goes wrong, please email me (link below) with as much
      detail as you can remember, and I'll try to fix it for you and
      everybody else.  For example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I clicked the period timer during a timeout and the Team A logo
        turned into a photo of a burrito.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h1>Enjoy!</h1>
