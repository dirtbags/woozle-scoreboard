    <ul>
      <li>
        When the period clock is gray, you can click on almost
        anything to change it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press Space Bar or "J", or click the jam timer, to begin a jam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press "A" to give a point to team A, or "B" to give a point to
        team B.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press "Shift+A" to deduct a point from team A, or "Shift+B" to
        deduct a point from team B".
      </li>
      <li>
        Press Space Bar, "R", or "L"; or click the jam timer, to end a
        jam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press "T" or click the period clock for a timeout.  This turns
        the period clock gray: you can adjust elements (period clock,
        scores, etc.) during timeouts by clicking them.
      </li>
    </ul>
      

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <img src="sb1.png" alt="Scoreboard startup">
    <p>
      When you first load the scoreboard, it will reset to some default
      values.  You can begin using it right away if you like, but you
      will probably want to change the team names and logos first.
      Until you start the first jam, and during timeouts, almost
      everything on the screen can be edited by clicking it.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up team names and logos</h2>
    <img src="sb2.png" alt="Scoreboard with team names">
    <p>
      Click on a team name to change it, then click a team logo to
      provide a URL for that team.  You can copy and paste the URL of
      any image you find on the Internet, but it's probably best to
      download images to your hard drive so that your scoreboard doesn't
      depend on an Internet connection to operate.
    </p>

    <h2>Adjust period clock and period number</h2>
    <p>
      The period clock defaults to 30:00 the first time the scoreboard
      loads, but will use whatever value it last had from then on.  If
      you want to set the period clock to something else, click it and
      type in the new time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also click the period indicator to change from Period 1 to
      Period 2.
    </p>

    <h2>Adjust team scores</h2>
    <p>
      Clicking on a team's score brings up a dialog box to adjust their
      score.
    </p>

    <h2>Put the scoreboard on the projector</h2>
    <p>
      When everything is set up the way you want it, drag the browser
      window to whatever screen is being projected, and make the browser
      full-screen (usually the F11 key, or in the View menu).
    </p>

    <h1>Running a bout</h1>
    <img src="sb3.png" alt="Scoreboard with team names">
    <p>
      The scoreboard was designed to be easy to operate with the
      keyboard: you can just hit space bar most of the time, with "T"
      for timeouts, use "A" and "B" to award points, and "Shift-A" and
      "Shift-B" to deduct points.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting a jam</h2>
    <p>
      When the ref signals the start of the first jam (one short
      whistle), start the jam timer by clicking on it, or typing Space
      Bar or "J".  You're off!  The state indicator will show "Jam" and
      the jam timer will count down from 2 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Awarding or deducting points</h2>
    <p>
      To award points to teams, click on the team's score or type "A" or
      "B".  You can award points during a jam or between jams.
    </p>

    <p>
      To deduct points, click on the team's name or logo, or type
      "Shift-A" or "Shift-B".  Points can be deducted during a jam or
      between jams.
    </p>


    <h2>Ending a jam</h2>
    <img src="sb4.png" alt="Scoreboard between jams">
    <p>
      When the ref signals the end of the jam (four short whistles),
      click the jam timer again, or type Space Bar, "R", or "L".  The
      state indicator will show "Rotation" and the jam timer  will count
      down from 30 seconds.
    </p>


    <h2>Timeouts</h2>
    <img src="sb5.png" alt="Scoreboard during timeout">
    <p>
      For any timeout, be it a team timeout or official timeout, click
      the period clock or type "T".  This changes the state indicator to
      "Timeout", pauses the period clock, and makes the jam timer track
      how long the timeout has lasted by counting up from 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      Team timeouts are only supposed to last one minute.  It's the
      referee's responsibility to signal the start of the next jam, and
      the period clock shouldn't start counting down again until this
      happens.
    </p>

    <h1>Making changes during a bout</h1>
    <p>
      If you need to adjust the period clock or make major adujustments
      to team scores, you must first enter a timeout by clicking the
      period clock or typing "T".  When in timeout, the procedure for
      making changes things is the same as during setup.
    </p>

    <h1>If the browser exits</h1>
    <p>
      Shit happens.  So every second, the scoreboard saves its state to the
      browser's long-term storage using the
      HTML5 <code>localStorage</code> object.  The following information
      is stored, and will come back the way it was when the browser exited:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Period clock time</li>
      <li>Team names</li>
      <li>Team logo URLs</li>
      <li>Team scores</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is a good idea to verify that your browser actually stores this
      information around before you run a bout, by starting a pretend
      jam, exiting, then re-opening.
    </p>

    <h1>Customizing the display</h1>
    <p>
      The scoreboard is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.  If you'd
      like to try your hand at graphic design, feel encouraged to do
      so.  Just remember to keep the <code>onclick</code>
      and <code>id</code> attributes in elements that have them, and
      everything should continue to work.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you come up with a new design, or code improvements, I'd love
      to see it!
    </p>

    <h1>If you have problems</h1>
    <p>
      If something goes wrong, please email me (link below) with as much
      detail as you can remember, and I'll try to fix it for you and
      everybody else.  For example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I clicked the period timer during a timeout and the Team A logo
        turned was replaced with a photo of a burrito.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
